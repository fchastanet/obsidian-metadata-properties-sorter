# GitHub Copilot Instructions

On chat, only provide the relevant changes but not all the files.

In agent mode, always edit the files.

Generate code as a senior developer, not as a beginner.

Use adapter design pattern to integrate external api, instead of using it directly.

Use MVC design pattern.

Use services with dependency injection.

Always update/create associated unit tests.

Prefer using the command `npm run test` as test integration in vscode is buggy.
