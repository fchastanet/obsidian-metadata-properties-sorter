Add a lot of emojis to identify the type of change (e.g., 🐛 for bug fixes, ✨ for
new features, 🚀 for performance improvements, 📝 for documentation updates). And
also identify the feature or component affected (e.g., 📦 for package updates, 🖥️
for UI changes, 🔧 for configuration changes).

Emojis on details as well.

changes made.

When generating commit messages:

- First line should be a concise summary (50-72 characters)

  characters)
- Use bullet points for detailed changes
